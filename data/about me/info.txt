Eager to explore new horizons by solving complex problems, I am specializing in Software Development and Artificial Intelligence solutions, concentrating on three areas:
 1. Generative Artificial Intelligence, which covers concepts such as Data Generation, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Prompt Engineering.
 2. Combinatorial Artificial Intelligence, involving the observation and development of bots in video games, with an emphasis on strategic decision-making, pathfinding, and adaptive behaviors in dynamic game environments.
 3. Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Vehicles, focusing on the development of algorithms for real-time decision-making in complex and dynamic environments.

Currently enrolled in a Master of Science in Computer Science with a Major on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, I will graduate in September 2025.
I have prior work experience as a Developer and Engineer in Software Companies (Profile and CRNS).

Over the years and thanks to the excellent courses I have followed, I have built a solid foundation, particularly in programming. 
This foundation has allowed me to master algorithms, ensuring that I am not dependent on any specific programming language and can adapt to various situations.
I have developed in more than 10 different programming languages, with the main ones being Java, Python, and C++.
